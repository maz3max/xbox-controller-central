# XBox One Controller BLE central

This project uses an XBox One controller as input. Goal is to forward this input to a USB HID interface.
The input part is designed to be a library so it can be reused easily.
ZBUS is used for messaging so that the BLE part will not be stalled by any subsequent processing.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper Zephyr development
environment. Follow the official
[Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (``my-workspace``) where
the ``example-application`` and all Zephyr modules will be cloned. Run the following
command:

```shell
# initialize my-workspace for the example-application (main branch)
west init -m https://github.com/maz3max/xbox-controller-central --mr main my-workspace
# update Zephyr modules
cd my-workspace
west update
```

### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
west build -b $BOARD app
```

where `$BOARD` is the target board.

A sample debug configuration is also provided. To apply it, run the following
command:

```shell
west build -b $BOARD app -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=debug.conf
```

Once you have built the application, run the following command to flash it:

```shell
west flash
```
